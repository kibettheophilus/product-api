## Product catalog API

###What
This API serves as the central hub for product information, enabling clients to create, read, update, and delete product data, and support filtering functionality.

###Why
Modern e-commerce platforms require robust, scalable, and maintainable product management systems. Some business needs addressed by the Product Catalog API:
Centralized Product Management: Provides a single source of truth for all product information reducing inconsistencies and improving data integrity.
Integration Flexibility: Enables seamless integration with various front-end applications, mobile apps, and third-party services through standardized REST endpoints or GraphQL queries/mutations, reducing development time and complexity.
Expected Results
Upon successful implementation and deployment, the Product Catalog API will deliver the following outcomes:
Functional Capabilities: Complete CRUD operations for products and related entities and filtering by multiple attributes.
Integration Success: Seamless integration with existing systems using RESTful endpoints or GraphQL queries/mutations that follow industry standards with API documentation.
Steps
Foundation Setup
Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript configuration and establish project structure.
Set up the development environment including database connections.
Design and implement database schema.
Core API Development
Choose API architecture (REST, GraphQL, or hybrid approach) based on requirements analysis
Develop product CRUD operations with validation and error handling
Create data models
If GraphQL: Design schema, implement resolvers, and set up type definitions
If REST: Design endpoint structure, implement routing, and establish response formats
Advanced Features
Implement filtering capabilities
Testing and Documentation
Complete unit testing suite with high coverage requirements
Implement integration testing for all API endpoints
Generate comprehensive API documentation with examples
Conduct performance testing and optimization
Security and Deployment
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
Set up production deployment pipeline
Possible challenges
API Versioning and Backward Compatibility: As the API evolves, maintaining backward compatibility while introducing new features requires thoughtful versioning strategies and deprecation policies to avoid breaking existing integrations. This is particularly complex with GraphQL's schema evolution.
